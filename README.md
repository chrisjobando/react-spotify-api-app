## Christopher Obando's Spotify App
Welcome to my Spotify App!


This is my first major personal project, using the ReactJS Framework, HTML, SASS, and JSX!


I created this app initially to work with the Spotify API to get my Top Tracks/Artists of all time out of curiousity,
but I enjoyed working with the API so much that I decided to create an entire web application to pair with my Spotify.


## Currently, this app can:
#### `- Display your 10 most recently played tracks`
#### `- Browse tracks, artists, albums, and playlists`
#### `- See your playlists`
#### `- Control your Spotify player (on another player - in-browser, downloadable PC, or mobile app`
#### `- Show your Top 25 tracks/artists from the past month, 6 months, or all-time!`


## Intended Future Features:
#### `- Generate playlists based on the user's preferences`
#### `- Show more personalized user statistics based on their listening preferences`
